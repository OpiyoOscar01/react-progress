# React Learning Tracker

This repository is dedicated to my journey of learning **React.js** — not every little detail, but just what's **practically necessary** to build real-world projects.

---

## Goal

To understand and apply the **core concepts** of React so I can:

- Build useful, working React applications
- Gain hands-on experience with components, props, hooks, and state
- Learn by doing, not just reading

---

## What I’m Focusing On

- Functional Components
- JSX and Rendering Logic
- Props and Children
- useState & useEffect Hooks
- Conditional Rendering
- Lifting State Up
- Forms and Events
- React Router (basic routing)
- Component Reusability
- Fetching Data (API integration)

---

## Project-Based Learning

This is not just notes — I’ll be creating small apps or components along the way to reinforce what I learn.

---

## Notes and Progress

Each key topic may include:

- A `.md` file summarizing what I’ve learned
- A React component or mini-project demonstrating the concept

---

## Why This Repo Exists

I wanted a focused place where I can:

- Document my learning path
- Track my growth over time
- Help others who want to learn React practically, not academically
